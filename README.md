# SlackEmojiDownloader
A tool to download custom emojis from Slack

I based this on https://gist.github.com/lmarkus/8722f56baf8c47045621 but made some corrections.  I created this repo since lmarkus did not have a repo setup (he used a gist to publish).

To use:

1. Open a Slack messages window in your browser.
2. Open the emoji picker.
3. Open a Javascript console (in Developer Tools in Chrome).
4. Copy-paste the content of the extract.js file into the console.
5. Copy the output into a text file.
6. Run download.sh <text file name>.
